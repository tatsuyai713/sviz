## Installation

Use the live deployment at [sviz.metaverseindustries.llc](https://sviz.metaverseindustries.llc/) or build the project from source and deploy the contents of `web/.webpack` to a web server.

## Open Source

sviz is primarily written in TypeScript – contributions are welcome!

The official binary distributions available at [studio.foxglove.dev](https://studio.foxglove.dev/) or [foxglove.dev/download](https://foxglove.dev/download) incorporate some closed-source functionality, such as integration with [Foxglove Data Platform](https://foxglove.dev/data-platform), multiple layouts, private extensions, and more. For more information on free and paid features, see our [Pricing](https://foxglove.dev/pricing).

## Self-hosting

Foxglove Studio can be self-hosted using our [docker image](https://ghcr.io/foxglove/studio). Please note that this build does not contain any closed source functionality.

```sh
docker run --rm -p "80:80" ghcr.io/tatsuyai713/sviz:latest
```

Foxglove Studio will be accessible in your browser at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

### Overriding the default layout

[Bind-mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) a layout JSON file at `/foxglove/default-layout.json` to set the default layout used when loading Studio from the Docker image.

```sh
docker run --rm -p "80:80" -v /path/to/custom_layout.json:/foxglove/default-layout.json ghcr.io/tatsuyai713/sviz:latest
```

### Self-hosted extensions

You can deliver a fixed set of extensions when self-hosting by [bind-mounting](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) a directory containing one or more `.foxe` extensions and a `manifest.json` to `/src/extensions`. The format for the manifest JSON is as follows:

```json
{
  "packages": {
    "<extension-id>": {
      "url": "/extensions/<filename>.foxe",
      "config": {
        "name": "<extension-name>",
        "displayName": "...",
        "...": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```
